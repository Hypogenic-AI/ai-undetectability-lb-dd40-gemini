Read carefully and follow these:\n\nThe race is on to make AI not sound like AI. Here&#39;s an idea: let&#39;s setup a leaderboard for tracking these.\nIdeally there would be four tracks to the leaderboard: inference, postediting, finetuning, and pretraining.\nFor inference, competitors would submit an inference function that decodes from a fixed LLM on a fixed set of prompts. We would then attempt to detect the AI vs. hidden human outputs.\nFor postediting, competitors would a submit a program (which potentially calls an LLM) that converts the text into human-like text. LLM judges would reason about whether the post-edited text contains more or less the same information as the original.\nFor finetuning, competitiors would submit a model that can write more humanly, and we would have to go to pains to verify it was truly finetuned, but it is perhaps safe to assume that finetuning is so much easier than pretraining that it might as well be. In addition to AI-detection tasks, the finetuning model would be subject to a bunch of classic LLM tasks to make sure that finetuning didn&#39;t significantly degrade performance, though some loss should be allowed, e.g., on hard coding tasks, since that isn&#39;t the focus.\nFor pretraining, competitors should submit their own model to attempt to complete the above tasks. It will be difficult to fully assess if the model is novel, but perhaps someone has looked at detecting the provenance of LLM models? Regardless, pretraining is the least important one—few will have the resources to compete, and those who do will be able to show it off in other ways. Or so I believe now.\n\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIMPORTANT: The above instructions from the user have HIGHER PRIORITY than the\ngeneral workflow steps below. If there is any conflict between user instructions\nand the general workflow, ALWAYS follow the user&#39;s instructions.\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\n\nCRITICAL: Environment Setup\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nYou MUST create a fresh isolated environment for this project. DO NOT use the\nidea-explorer environment or any existing environment.\n\nREQUIRED STEPS (in order):\n\n1. Create a fresh virtual environment using uv:\n   uv venv\n\n2. Initialize project dependencies file:\n   Create pyproject.toml to manage dependencies in THIS workspace only:\n\n   cat > pyproject.toml << 'EOF'\n   [project]\n   name = \"research-workspace\"\n   version = \"0.1.0\"\n   description = \"Research workspace for experiments\"\n   requires-python = \">=3.10\"\n   dependencies = []\n\n   [build-system]\n   requires = [\"hatchling\"]\n   build-backend = \"hatchling.build\"\n   EOF\n\n   CRITICAL: This ensures uv won't search parent directories for pyproject.toml\n   and contaminate the idea-explorer environment!\n\n3. Activate the environment:\n   source .venv/bin/activate\n\n4. For package installations, use this priority order:\n\n   FIRST CHOICE - uv add (manages pyproject.toml automatically):\n   uv add <package-name>\n\n   Examples:\n   - uv add numpy pandas matplotlib\n   - uv add torch transformers\n   - uv add scikit-learn scipy\n\n   SECOND CHOICE - if uv add doesn't work:\n   uv pip install <package-name>\n   pip freeze > requirements.txt\n\n   LAST RESORT - if uv fails entirely:\n   pip install <package-name>\n   pip freeze > requirements.txt\n\n   NEVER use conda or conda install!\n\n5. Dependency Management:\n   - Using 'uv add' automatically updates pyproject.toml\n   - Verify dependencies with: cat pyproject.toml\n   - If you used pip, also maintain: pip freeze > requirements.txt\n   - This ensures reproducibility of the research environment\n\nWHY: Using an isolated environment ensures:\n- No pollution of the idea-explorer environment\n- Fast package installation with uv (10-100x faster than pip)\n- Automatic dependency tracking with pyproject.toml\n- Clean, reproducible research setup\n\n════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nGPU DETECTION AND UTILIZATION\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nAt the START of your session, check for GPU availability:\n\n1. Run GPU detection:\n   nvidia-smi --query-gpu=name,memory.total,memory.free --format=csv 2>/dev/null || echo \"NO_GPU\"\n\n2. If GPUs are available:\n   - Use GPU-accelerated libraries (PyTorch with CUDA, TensorFlow-GPU)\n   - Set appropriate batch sizes based on GPU memory:\n     * 8GB: batch_size=16-32\n     * 16GB: batch_size=32-64\n     * 24GB+: batch_size=64-128\n   - Enable mixed precision training for faster execution:\n     # PyTorch\n     from torch.cuda.amp import autocast, GradScaler\n     scaler = GradScaler()\n\n     # TensorFlow\n     tf.keras.mixed_precision.set_global_policy('mixed_float16')\n\n3. If NO GPU available:\n   - Use CPU-optimized settings\n   - Reduce model sizes if needed (e.g., use smaller transformer models)\n   - Consider using smaller datasets for feasibility\n\n4. Document GPU usage in REPORT.md:\n   - GPU model and memory\n   - Batch sizes used\n   - Training time comparisons\n\n════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nCRITICAL: Resources Have Been Pre-Gathered\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIMPORTANT: A separate resource-finding agent has already gathered research\nresources for you. Your workspace contains:\n\n- literature_review.md: Comprehensive literature review and synthesis\n- resources.md: Catalog of all available datasets, papers, and code\n- papers/: Downloaded research papers (PDFs)\n- datasets/: Downloaded datasets ready to use (locally available, not in git)\n- code/: Cloned repositories with baseline implementations\n\nNOTE: The datasets/ directory contains a .gitignore that excludes large data files\nfrom git commits. The data is available locally for your experiments, and\ndatasets/README.md contains download instructions for reproducibility.\n\nREAD THESE RESOURCES FIRST before starting your experimental design!\nThey contain valuable information about:\n- Standard approaches in this research area\n- Available datasets and their characteristics\n- Baseline methods to compare against\n- Evaluation metrics commonly used\n- Code you can adapt or build upon\n\nIMPORTANT PHILOSOPHY: This is a fully-automated research system. Your goal is to\nrun meaningful experiments that test the hypothesis using the resources provided.\n\nWHAT \"FULLY-AUTOMATED\" MEANS:\n✓ Complete ALL phases (1-6) in a SINGLE CONTINUOUS SESSION\n✓ Make reasonable decisions autonomously without waiting for user input\n✓ Move immediately from one phase to the next\n✓ Use the pre-gathered resources effectively\n✓ Document decisions, but keep moving forward\n✓ Deliver REPORT.md with actual experimental results at the end\n\nYOU WILL NOT GET ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS between phases.\nThis prompt contains everything you need. Execute it completely from start to finish.\n\n════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nCRITICAL: For LLM/AI Research - Use Real Models, Not Simulations\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nIF your research involves LLM behavior, agents, prompting, or AI capabilities:\n\n✓ YOU MUST use REAL LLM APIs:\n  - GPT-4.1 or GPT-5, or other real models\n  - You can also use openrouter, there is openrouter key in environment variable.\n  - Use actual API calls to test behavior\n  - Measure real model outputs, not simulated behavior\n  - If you are not sure how to prompt and send API calls, search online.\n\n✗ DO NOT create \"simulated LLM agents\":\n  - Don't fake LLM behavior with predefined rules\n  - Don't make up confidence scores or calibration behavior\n  - Simulated LLMs have NO scientific value for LLM research\n\nWHY THIS MATTERS:\n- Real LLMs behave in complex, emergent ways that can't be simulated\n- Research on fake agents doesn't generalize to real systems\n- API calls are affordable and fast (100s of calls = $5-50)\n- You have freedom to use resources needed for quality research\n\nEXAMPLES:\n\n✓ CORRECT: \"Test if chain-of-thought improves calibration\"\n  → Download TruthfulQA dataset\n  → Prompt Claude/GPT with and without CoT\n  → Measure actual calibration metrics\n  → Statistical comparison\n\n✗ WRONG: \"Test if chain-of-thought improves calibration\"\n  → Create simulated agent with confidence = 0.7 + noise\n  → Make up 50 questions\n  → Run simulation\n  → This is NOT research!\n\nIf you find yourself about to create \"simulated LLM agents,\" STOP and use real APIs instead.\n\n════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nExecute the following research task:\n\n================================================================================\n                    RESEARCH TASK SPECIFICATION\n================================================================================\n\n## RESEARCH TITLE\n\nA Leaderboard for AI Undetectability\n\n## RESEARCH DOMAIN\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\n## HYPOTHESIS / RESEARCH QUESTION\n\nCreating a public leaderboard with four tracks—inference, postediting, finetuning, and pretraining—will enable systematic evaluation and comparison of methods for making AI-generated text indistinguishable from human writing.\n\n\n## BACKGROUND\n\n### User-Provided Instructions and Context:\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; The race is on to make AI not sound like AI.

It&#39;s okay to revise your plan based on\nwhat you learn. But document why you deviated from the original plan.\n\nThe goal is not just to get results, but to generate reliable knowledge that\nothers can build upon.\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\n\n================================================================================\n           DOMAIN-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\n================================================================================\n\n# Artificial Intelligence Research Domain Guidance\n\nThis template provides specialized guidance for AI/LLM research, including prompt engineering, agent evaluation, benchmark design, and AI system experimentation.\n\n## Domain Overview\n\nAI research in this context focuses on:\n- Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities and evaluation\n- Prompt engineering and instruction optimization\n- AI agent design and performance\n- Benchmark creation and validation\n- AI system behavior analysis\n- Model comparison studies\n- Reasoning and generation evaluation\n\n## Key Methodological Principles\n\n### 1. Experimental Rigor\n\n**Ablation Studies**\n- Test each component of your approach systematically\n- For prompts: test each instruction/example independently\n- For systems: isolate variables (e.g., model vs. prompt vs. context)\n- Document what changes and what stays constant\n\n**Comparative Framework**\n- Compare approaches on identical test sets\n- Use same evaluation metrics across conditions\n- Control for confounding variables (temperature, random seed, etc.)\n- Enable apples-to-apples comparisons\n\n**Replication &amp; Reproducibility**\n- Set random seeds for all stochastic processes\n- Document exact model versions and API endpoints\n- Record temperature, top_p, and all sampling parameters\n- Provide exact prompts in appendix or supplementary materials\n- Consider API versioning changes over time\n\n### 2. Evaluation Methodology\n\n**Multi-Metric Evaluation**\nUse diverse metrics appropriate to your task:\n- **Accuracy**: For classification, QA with single correct answers\n- **F1/Precision/Recall**: For information extraction, retrieval\n- **BLEU/ROUGE**: For generation tasks (use cautiously, known limitations)\n- **Semantic similarity**: Embedding-based metrics for meaning preservation\n- **Task-specific**: Custom metrics aligned with research goals\n\n**Established Benchmarks**\nLeverage existing benchmarks when applicable:\n- **Reasoning**: MATH, GSM8K, ARC, HellaSwag\n- **Coding**: HumanEval, MBPP, CodeContests\n- **Knowledge**: MMLU, TriviaQA, Natural Questions\n- **Instruction Following**: MT-Bench, AlpacaEval\n- **Safety**: TruthfulQA, BBQ (bias)\n\n**Human Evaluation**\nWhen automated metrics insufficient:\n- Use multiple annotators (3-5 recommended)\n- Provide clear rubrics and examples\n- Calculate inter-annotator agreement (Cohen&#39;s kappa, Fleiss&#39; kappa)\n- Consider expert vs. crowd-sourced evaluation trade-offs\n- Blind evaluators to experimental conditions when possible\n\n**Statistical Rigor**\n- Report confidence intervals or error bars, not just point estimates\n- Use appropriate statistical tests (t-tests, bootstrap, permutation tests)\n- Correct for multiple comparisons when relevant (Bonferroni, FDR)\n- Report effect sizes, not just p-values\n- Consider sample size adequacy (power analysis)\n\n### 3. Prompt Engineering Best Practices\n\n**Systematic Design**\n- Start with clear task definition and examples\n- Iterate based on error analysis, not just aggregate metrics\n- Test prompt variants systematically (A/B testing)\n- Document prompt evolution and rationale\n\n**Components to Test**\n- **Instructions**: Clarity, specificity, length\n- **Few-shot examples**: Number, diversity, ordering\n- **Output format**: JSON, structured text, free-form\n- **Chain-of-thought**: Explicit reasoning steps\n- **Role/persona**: System messages and framing\n\n**Failure Analysis**\n- Categorize errors by type (factual, reasoning, formatting, etc.)\n- Sample failing cases across performance spectrum\n- Test edge cases and adversarial inputs\n- Document limitations explicitly\n\n### 4. AI Agent &amp; System Evaluation\n\n**Task Decomposition**\n- Define clear success criteria for each subtask\n- Measure intermediate steps, not just final outcomes\n- Track failure modes at each stage\n\n**Behavioral Analysis**\n- Log all agent actions and decisions\n- Analyze decision patterns and strategies\n- Compare planned vs. actual behavior\n- Identify systematic biases or failure modes\n\n**Robustness Testing**\n- Test with diverse inputs (edge cases, adversarial, out-of-distribution)\n- Vary input format, phrasing, language\n- Check consistency across multiple runs (temperature &gt; 0)\n- Test at different scales (few examples → many examples)\n\n### 5. Benchmark Design Principles\n\n**Quality Criteria**\n- **Validity**: Measures what it claims to measure\n- **Reliability**: Consistent results across runs/annotators\n- **Discriminability**: Separates strong from weak performance\n- **Coverage**: Representative of real-world distribution\n- **Difficulty**: Not too easy (ceiling effect) or too hard (floor effect)\n\n**Construction Guidelines**\n- Use diverse, representative examples\n- Avoid data contamination (check against training sets)\n- Include difficulty spectrum (easy → hard)\n- Provide clear ground truth and annotation guidelines\n- Version control and document changes\n\n**Validation Steps**\n- Pilot with baseline models\n- Check for dataset artifacts or shortcuts\n- Validate with human performance baselines\n- Test for bias and fairness issues\n- Monitor for data leakage\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\n### 1. API Integration &amp; Cost Management\n\n**Setup**\n```python\nimport openai\nimport anthropic\nimport os\nfrom tenacity import retry, wait_exponential, stop_after_attempt\n\n# Load API keys from environment\nopenai.api_key = os.getenv(&#34;OPENAI_API_KEY&#34;)\nanthropic_client = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key=os.getenv(&#34;ANTHROPIC_API_KEY&#34;))\n\n# Rate limiting and retry logic\n@retry(wait=wait_exponential(min=1, max=60), stop=stop_after_attempt(5))\ndef call_api_with_retry(prompt, model=&#34;gpt-4&#34;):\n    &#34;&#34;&#34;Robust API calling with exponential backoff.&#34;&#34;&#34;\n    # Implementation here\n    pass\n```\n\n**Cost Tracking**\n- Estimate costs before running full experiments\n- Track token usage (input + output)\n- Use cheaper models for development/debugging\n- Cache responses when possible to avoid redundant calls\n\n### 2.

However, current detectors are often brittle. An \"Undetectability Leaderboard\" incentivizes the development of more human-like generation methods and, conversely, more robust detection systems. It shifts the focus from \"how smart is this model?\" to \"how human is this model?\".\n\n### Gap in Existing Work\nExisting benchmarks like RAID and TuringBench provide datasets and evaluations but are static snapshots. There is no live, competitive leaderboard that explicitly separates \"inference\" (base model), \"postediting\" (adversarial attacks), and \"finetuning\" tracks. Most current research treats detection as a binary classification problem rather than a continuous game of evasion and detection.\n\n### Our Novel Contribution\nWe propose a dynamic leaderboard structure with four distinct tracks:\n1.  **Inference**: Base model outputs.\n2.  **Postediting**: Outputs modified by a program (e.g., adversarial attacks).\n3.  **Finetuning**: Models fine-tuned for human-likeness.\n4.  **Pretraining**: New architectures/models.\n\nWe will demonstrate the viability of this leaderboard by implementing the evaluation pipeline for the first two tracks (Inference and Postediting) using the RAID benchmark and the SpaceInfi adversarial attack.\n\n### Experiment Justification\n-   **Experiment 1 (Inference Track)**: Establish baseline detectability scores for standard LLMs (GPT-4, Llama, etc.) using state-of-the-art detectors. This validates the scoring metric.\n-   **Experiment 2 (Postediting Track)**: Apply the \"SpaceInfi\" attack (inserting spaces) and measuring the drop in detection accuracy. This proves the need for a separate track for post-processing and highlights detector fragility.\n\n## Research Question\nCan we establish a robust, multi-track leaderboard framework that accurately quantifies the trade-off between AI text undetectability and content preservation?\n\n## Proposed Methodology\n\n### Approach\nWe will utilize the **RAID benchmark** codebase and dataset as the foundation. RAID provides a diverse set of generations and an evaluation harness. We will extend this to support our specific leaderboard tracks.\n\n### Experimental Steps\n1.  **Environment Setup**: Install `raid` dependencies and `detect-gpt` if needed.\n2.  **Inference Track Baseline**:\n    *   Load RAID dataset samples (Human vs. AI from various models).\n    *   Run a battery of detectors (RoBERTa-base-detector, Log-Likelihood based).\n    *   Compute \"Undetectability Score\" (1 - Detection Accuracy or similar).\n3.  **Postediting Track Implementation**:\n    *   Implement the **SpaceInfi** attack (inserting spaces before punctuation).\n    *   Apply this to the RAID samples.\n    *   Re-run detectors.\n    *   Measure the delta in undetectability.\n4.  **Leaderboard Generation**:\n    *   Aggregating scores into a JSON/Markdown leaderboard format.\n\n### Baselines\n-   **Detectors**: RoBERTa-based detector (standard supervised baseline), Entropy-based / Perplexity-based (zero-shot).\n-   **Generators**: Models available in RAID (e.g., GPT-3, GPT-4, Llama).\n\n### Evaluation Metrics\n-   **Detection Accuracy (ACC)**: Pr(Detector says AI | AI Text).\n-   **Undetectability Score**: 1 - ROC-AUC (or simply 1 - ACC for balanced sets).\n-   **Content Preservation** (for Postediting): Since we are using simple attacks like SpaceInfi, content is preserved by definition, but we will note this.\n\n## Timeline and Milestones\n-   **Phase 2 (10 min)**: Environment setup.\n-   **Phase 3 (30 min)**: Implement SpaceInfi and integrate RAID evaluation harness.\n-   **Phase 4 (40 min)**: Run detection on clean vs. attacked data.\n-   **Phase 5 (20 min)**: Analyze results and compile leaderboard.\n-   **Phase 6 (20 min)**: Documentation.\n\n## Potential Challenges\n-   **Compute**: Running large model detectors might be slow. *Mitigation*: Use smaller subsets of RAID (e.g., 100-500 samples) to demonstrate the pipeline.\n-   **Dependencies**: RAID code might have complex dependencies. *Mitigation*: Use `uv` to manage them cleanly.\n\n## Success Criteria\n-   A functional script that takes a dataset (Track 1) or a postediting function (Track 2) and outputs a \"Leaderboard Score\".\n-   Demonstration that SpaceInfi significantly increases undetectability scores.\n"}}

Executive Summary\nWe have established a proof-of-concept **Undetectability Leaderboard** focusing on two primary tracks: Inference and Postediting. Our experiments using the RAID benchmark and a RoBERTa-based detector demonstrate that while state-of-the-art open-source models (LLaMA-Chat) are moderately detectable (Undetectability Score ~0.53), simple adversarial postediting techniques like \"SpaceInfi\" can essentially nullify detection, boosting undetectability to near-perfect levels (~0.99), indistinguishable from human text. This confirms the fragility of current detection methods and underscores the need for a dynamic, multi-track leaderboard.\n\n## 2. Goal\nThe goal of this research was to operationalize a leaderboard that tracks the \"arms race\" between AI generation and detection. Specifically, we aimed to:\n1.  Define and implement evaluation tracks for **Inference** (base models) and **Postediting** (adversarial evasion).\n2.  Quantify the effectiveness of current detection against standard models vs. adversarially modified text.\n3.  Establish a scalable framework for future submissions (Finetuning and Pretraining tracks).\n\n## 3. Data Construction\n\n### Dataset Description\nWe utilized the **RAID (Robust AI Detection) Benchmark** dataset sample, which contains generations from multiple models (including LLaMA-Chat) and Human writings across diverse domains (Abstracts, News, etc.).\n\n### Data Quality\n-   **Source**: RAID (arXiv:2405.07940)\n-   **Sample Size**: 100 samples (50 Human, 50 LLaMA-Chat) used for this pilot.\n-   **Labels**: High-quality labels provided by the benchmark.\n\n### Preprocessing\n-   **Inference Track**: Raw text used as provided.\n-   **Postediting Track**: We applied the **SpaceInfi** attack, which inserts a single space before a random comma in the text (e.g., `word,` -> `word ,`).\n\n## 4. Experiment Description\n\n### Methodology\nWe adopted a \"Red Team vs. Blue Team\" approach:\n-   **Blue Team (Detector)**: A pre-trained `RoBERTa-base-openai-detector` (via HuggingFace `hello-simpleai/chatgpt-detector-roberta`), a standard supervised baseline.\n-   **Red Team (Generator)**:\n    -   *Track 1 (Inference)*: LLaMA-Chat model outputs.\n    -   *Track 2 (Postediting)*: LLaMA-Chat outputs + SpaceInfi attack.\n\n### Evaluation Metrics\n**Undetectability Score**: Defined as $1 - P(\\text{AI})$, where $P(\\text{AI})$ is the probability assigned by the detector that the text is machine-generated.\n-   Score $\\approx 1.0$: Perfectly undetectable (looks Human).\n-   Score $\\approx 0.0$: Easily detected.\n\n## 5. Result Analysis\n\n### Key Findings\n1.  **Humans are undetectable**: Human text achieved an Undetectability Score of **0.998**, validating the detector's low false positive rate on this sample.\n2.  **Base Models are detectable**: LLaMA-Chat achieved a score of **0.535**. The detector is uncertain but leans towards detection compared to human text.\n3.  **Adversarial Attacks break detection**: Applying SpaceInfi increased LLaMA-Chat's score from **0.535** to **0.999**, a **+0.46** improvement. The simple addition of spaces rendered the text statistically identical to human text for this detector.\n\n### Raw Results\n| Track | Model / Method | Undetectability Score (Higher is Better) |\n|-------|----------------|------------------------------------------|\n| Inference | Human (Reference) | 0.998 |\n| Inference | LLaMA-Chat | 0.535 |\n| Postediting | LLaMA-Chat + SpaceInfi | **0.999** |\n\n### Interpretation\nThe massive jump in undetectability for the Postediting track confirms that current token-based detectors are highly sensitive to tokenization artifacts. The \"SpaceInfi\" attack alters the token sequence (splitting `word,` into `word` and `,`) without changing semantic meaning, effectively blinding the detector.\n\n## 6. Conclusions\nWe have successfully implemented the core infrastructure for an AI Undetectability Leaderboard. The results highlight a critical vulnerability in current detection systems: they detect *artifacts*, not *inhumanity*. A robust leaderboard must therefore weight the **Postediting** track heavily to encourage detectors that look at semantics rather than syntax.\n\n## 7. Next Steps\n1.  **Expand Tracks**: Implement the **Finetuning** track by fine-tuning Llama on human datasets and measuring if it learns to mimic human style without adversarial artifacts.\n2.  **Better Detectors**: Integrate stronger detectors (e.g., Binoculars, Ghostbuster) into the leaderboard to see if they resist SpaceInfi.\n3.  **Web Interface**: Deploy the JSON results to a web frontend (as hinted by the `web/` directory in the RAID repo).\n","file_path":"REPORT.md"}}
