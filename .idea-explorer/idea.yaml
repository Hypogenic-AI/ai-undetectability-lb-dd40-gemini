  title: A Leaderboard for AI Undetectability
  domain: artificial_intelligence
  hypothesis: "Creating a public leaderboard with four tracks\u2014inference, postediting,\
    \ finetuning, and pretraining\u2014will enable systematic evaluation and comparison\
    \ of methods for making AI-generated text indistinguishable from human writing.\n"
  background:
    description: "The race is on to make AI not sound like AI. Here's an idea: let's\
      \ setup a leaderboard for tracking these.\nIdeally there would be four tracks\
      \ to the leaderboard: inference, postediting, finetuning, and pretraining.\n\
      For inference, competitors would submit an inference function that decodes from\
      \ a fixed LLM on a fixed set of prompts. We would then attempt to detect the\
      \ AI vs. hidden human outputs.\nFor postediting, competitors would a submit\
      \ a program (which potentially calls an LLM) that converts the text into human-like\
      \ text. LLM judges would reason about whether the post-edited text contains\
      \ more or less the same information as the original.\nFor finetuning, competitiors\
      \ would submit a model that can write more humanly, and we would have to go\
      \ to pains to verify it was truly finetuned, but it is perhaps safe to assume\
      \ that finetuning is so much easier than pretraining that it might as well be.\
      \ In addition to AI-detection tasks, the finetuning model would be subject to\
      \ a bunch of classic LLM tasks to make sure that finetuning didn't significantly\
      \ degrade performance, though some loss should be allowed, e.g., on hard coding\
      \ tasks, since that isn't the focus.\nFor pretraining, competitors should submit\
      \ their own model to attempt to complete the above tasks. It will be difficult\
      \ to fully assess if the model is novel, but perhaps someone has looked at detecting\
      \ the provenance of LLM models? Regardless, pretraining is the least important\
      \ one\u2014few will have the resources to compete, and those who do will be\
      \ able to show it off in other ways. Or so I believe now."
