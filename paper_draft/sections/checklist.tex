    \item[] Guidelines: ...

\item {\bf Theory assumptions and proofs}
    \item[] Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof?
    \item[] Answer: \answerNA{}
    \item[] Justification: This paper is empirical and does not present theoretical proofs.
    \item[] Guidelines: ...

\item {\bf Experimental result reproducibility}
    \item[] Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?
    \item[] Answer: \answerYes{}
    \item[] Justification: We specify the dataset (RAID), the models (LLaMA-Chat, RoBERTa detector), and the attack method (SpaceInfi) in Section 3.
    \item[] Guidelines: ...

\item {\bf Open access to data and code}
    \item[] Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?
    \item[] Answer: \answerYes{}
    \item[] Justification: We use open-source datasets (RAID) and models available on HuggingFace.
    \item[] Guidelines: ...

\item {\bf Experimental setting/details}
    \item[] Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results?
    \item[] Answer: \answerYes{}
    \item[] Justification: Section 3 details the sample size and model checkpoints used.
    \item[] Guidelines: ...

\item {\bf Experiment statistical significance}
    \item[] Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments?
    \item[] Answer: \answerNo{}
    \item[] Justification: Given the pilot nature of the study with a small sample size (100), we report point estimates. Future work will include larger scales and error bars.
    \item[] Guidelines: ...

\item {\bf Experiments compute resources}
    \item[] Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments?
    \item[] Answer: \answerNo{}
    \item[] Justification: The experiments are lightweight inference tasks run on standard consumer hardware; specific compute resources are not critical for reproducibility here.
    \item[] Guidelines: ...

\item {\bf Code of ethics}
    \item[] Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics?
    \item[] Answer: \answerYes{}
    \item[] Justification: We reviewed the code of ethics and found no violations.
    \item[] Guidelines: ...

\item {\bf Broader impacts}
    \item[] Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed?
    \item[] Answer: \answerYes{}
    \item[] Justification: We discuss the implications for misinformation and academic integrity in the Introduction.
    \item[] Guidelines: ...

\item {\bf Safeguards}
    \item[] Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)?
    \item[] Answer: \answerNA{}
    \item[] Justification: We do not release new high-risk models; we evaluate existing ones.
    \item[] Guidelines: ...

\item {\bf Licenses for existing assets}
    \item[] Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected?
    \item[] Answer: \answerYes{}
    \item[] Justification: We cite the original authors of RAID, LLaMA, and the detectors.
    \item[] Guidelines: ...

\item {\bf New assets}
    \item[] Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets?
    \item[] Answer: \answerNA{}
    \item[] Justification: No new assets are introduced.
    \item[] Guidelines: ...

\item {\bf Crowdsourcing and research with human subjects}
    \item[] Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)?
    \item[] Answer: \answerNA{}
    \item[] Justification: No human subjects research was performed.
    \item[] Guidelines: ...

\item {\bf Institutional review board (IRB) approvals or equivalent for research with human subjects}
