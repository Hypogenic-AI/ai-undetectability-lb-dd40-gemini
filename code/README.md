# Cloned Repositories

## Repo 1: RAID (Robust AI Detection)
- **URL**: https://github.com/liamdugan/raid
- **Purpose**: Official implementation of the RAID benchmark. Contains scripts for evaluating detectors against diverse attacks and domains.
- **Location**: code/raid/
- **Key files**:
  - `run.py`: Likely the main entry point for evaluation.
  - `detectors/`: Implementations of various detectors.
  - `attack/`: Implementations of adversarial attacks.

## Repo 2: DetectGPT
- **URL**: https://github.com/eric-mitchell/detect-gpt
- **Purpose**: Official implementation of the DetectGPT method (zero-shot detection using probability curvature).
- **Location**: code/detect-gpt/
- **Key files**:
  - `run.py`: Main script to run experiments.
  - `detectgpt.py`: Core algorithm logic.

## Repo 3: TuringBench
- **URL**: https://github.com/AdaUchendu/TuringBench
- **Purpose**: Benchmark environment for Turing Test and Authorship Attribution.
- **Location**: code/turingbench/
- **Key files**:
  - `TuringBench/`: Core package.
  - `experiments/`: Experiment scripts.

## Missing Repos
- **SpaceInfi**: No official repo found. The method is simple (add space before comma) and can be implemented as a script in `scripts/`.
